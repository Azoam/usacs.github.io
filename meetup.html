    Rutgers Tech Meetup is a chance for the programming student body of Rutgers to come together and demo the awesome projects that they've been working on over the summer. Come see what open source projects, production ready apps, and side-project hacks your fellow students have built in their free time over the summer. We'll also be serving food and some awesome guest speaker talks.

    <p>RU Tech meetup will be held <b>6:30pm</b> in The Cove at the Busch Campus Center. <a href="http://rutechmeetup.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Get your ticket now</a>!
