    <h2>USACS is...</h2>
    <p>USACS, also known as the <b>Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer
    Scientists</b>, is a Computer Science interest group at Rutgers University.
    USACS primarily exists as a club that strings together a series of events
    for the Rutgers CS community. Our "members" are loosely defined as event
    regulars attendees and participants.</p>

    <p>In addition to our two big events that we plan on a semesterly basis,
    USACS runs <b>Code Red</b> every Friday from 1pm to 6pm in Hill 252, a
    program set up for 111 and 112 students to come in and get free tutoring 
    from USACS members. We also hold a weekly <b>Hacker Hour</b> session on 
    Fridays at 6pm after Code Red where upperclassmen teach subjects that CS 
    students would normally never have the opportunity to learn in the standard 
    CS curriculum at each Hacker Hour.</p>

    <p>USACS also manages a mentoring program that connects aspiring
    underclassmen CS students with experienced upperclassmen who can teach them
    practical, job-oriented CS skills.</a></p>

    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>To provide the tools and resources necessary for people interested in
    Computer Science to succeed inside and outside the classroom.</p>
